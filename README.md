# Fighb
Fighb (pronounce like fight with a b) is a very simple 2D web based fighting game game engine.

# Under development! Very far away from being ready to be used

# How to run
You need to have node.js installed on your machine. In case something does not work try updating your node.js version.
If you have node.js installed, then all you need to do is go into the folder you cloned this repository in, open a therminal window and type ```node server.js```
This should start a local server on port 5500 (a message in the therminal should appear). Go to your browser of choice and in the url type ```localhost:5500```
After you have done that, you should be ready to go. Have fun!

# The goal:
The goal is for anyone to be able to use this engine to create a fighting game without knowing how to program at all. Everything should be able to be done with the UI only.
